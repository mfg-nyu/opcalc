## Getting started

This project is bootstrapped with Create React APP, with TypeScript configured.

You may find the entire application's source code in `app.tsx`.

## Note: wasm support in React

As of CRA v4.0, React does not come with native support for webassembly yet.
This project follows [this tutorial](https://www.telerik.com/blogs/using-webassembly-with-react)
to make React webassembly-ready.
